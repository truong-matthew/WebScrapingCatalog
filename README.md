# WebScrapingCatalog
Libraries: (Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)

This is a web scraping project made as a supply intern to collect and estimate pricing and demand competitiveness of a Dropshipping Wholesaler Catalog in order to pre-screen and qualify vendors prior to having resources allocated to onboard them.

Based on the title of product listings and descriptions it would collect the product link as well as clean the data by extracting possible product SKU (unique product identifier used in e-commerce) from the page and format the data into a csv file for us to cross reference Looker data and internal inventory.
